## Using Github

## Tips
1. A [guide](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AlistairDoulin/20150304/237814/Git_for_Unity_Developers.php) on using Github from Gamasutra
2. An [article](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) about good branching practices. Seems pretty good but I haven't read it.
2. Make a separate scene for each prefab, so when you modify the prefab, the main scenes will not be modififed. As a result merge conflicts are avoided. as explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSo2pAYdQQQ)
